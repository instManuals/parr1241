# Precautions
- Always wear safety goggles.
- Do not overcharge the bomb: The sample should never release more than 8000 calories when burned in oxygen (always start with < 0.7 g of sample if unsure, and *never* use more than 1.5 g of combustible material).
- Do not overcharge the bomb with too much oxygen (use no more than 30 atm for most samples and 40 atm is absolute maximum).
- Do not fire the bomb if it is leaking (look for O2 gas bubbles escaping from it).
- Always ensure the bomb is fully submerged in water during firing.

# General Notes
- Label ALL samples/containers with:
      1. What the sample **composition** is (e.g. 0.5 M Nitric Acid in Water).  Be as descriptive as possible!
      2. The **date** the sample was created.
      3. Your **name**.
- Any unlabelled samples will be disposed of immediately.
- Any samples left in an instrumentation area or shared fume hood will be disposed of.  If you need lab or sample storage space please contact Al Fischer or Wes Bintz.
